# Challenge-two-of-week-2
 A function that takes a string and returns an array of length 2 containing a new string made of all and only the vowels from the original string and the number of duplicates in the original string

For example:


countVowels(‘dahdah’) # will return (‘a’, 3)
countVowels(‘drink water’) # will return (‘iae’, 1)
Arrays, conditional logic
Write a function named fizzBuzz that takes two(2) arrays and returns Fizz if the
combined length of the lists is divisible by 3, Buzz if it is divisible by 5, Fizzbuzz if it
is divisible by both 5 and 3 or the combined length of the list.


For example:
fizzBuzz([1, 2, 3], [ ]) # will return “fizz”
fizzBuzz([1, 2, 3], [1, 2]) # will return “buzz”
fizzBuzz([1, 2, 3], [1]) # will return 4
Copy the fizzbuzz folder to your solution repository, in there, there is a fizzbuzz.js
and fizzbuzz.test.js. fizzbuzz.test.js contains minimal tests for this challenge and
fizzbuzz.js contains an unimplemented fizzBuzz function. Implement the function to

pass all the tests. The goal is to write clean readable code that implements fizzBuzz
and passes all the tests. Feel free to add more tests.
